This is a collection of Python script to reproduce the electron density in the topside ionosphere obtained from LEO satellites.
It is a supplement to the Paper "Imaging of the ionosphere and plasmasphere using GNSS slant TEC obtained from LEO satellites" by Schreiter et. al., submitted in 2024 to the AGU journal Radio Science.

DOI: 10.22541/essoar.170612533.38060840/v1

As time span May and June 2020 are available. 
The 3DCut.py and 3DCutVert.py script can be used to compute electron density. Coefficients are in the MOD folder.
